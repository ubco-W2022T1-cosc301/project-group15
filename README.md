# Group 15 - Video Game Analytics

## Introduction
The purpose of our analysis is to find out data on video games. We want to know how video games had changed over time, how price or genre influences rating, language support, and other factors. We also want to see if there is a preference of the industry to produce particular genres of games.

## Dataset Description
The dataset we are using has a licence of CC0 and covers most of the games that were released on Steam up to mid-2019. It contains game ratings, languages available per game, prices for different games, release date, publisher and developer information, game tags, etc. The data here is from the popular game market Steam by Valve. This dataset suits our interest because video games are getting more and more popular with different age groups in society and our group has a large interest in different types of games in general. All three of us play video games on a regular basis and we would like to know more about the market and trends. That is the main reason we choose this dataset.

The data is also fairly representative of the gaming market since Steam is the largest digital marketplace for games. It covers almost all of the games that were released in the world.

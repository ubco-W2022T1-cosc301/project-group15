# Group 15 - Video Game Analytics

## Introduction
The purpose of our analysis is to find out data on video games. We want to know how video games had changed over time, how price or genre influences rating, language support, and other factors. We also want to see if there is a preference of the industry to produce particular genres of games.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words
The dataset we are using has a licence of CC0 and covers most of  the games that were released on Steam up to mid-2019. It contains game ratings, languages available per game, prices for different games, etc. The data here is from the popular game market Steam by Valve. This dataset suits our interest because video games are getting popular with different age groups in society and we have a keen interest in different types of games and that is the main reason we choose this dataset.

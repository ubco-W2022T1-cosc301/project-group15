The purpose of the dataset is to find out the popularity of steam games across different publishers and genres as well as to check when those games were released including a brief rating summary of those games. The dataset was provided by CC0 which covered all the games that were released up to 2019. It contained the recent and average rating score on different games. It also include the languages available and the price for different games. Those data in the table were referenced from the steam which is a video game digital distribution service and storefront by Valve company. This dataset suits our interest because video games are getting popular with different age groups in the society and numerous games are released throughout the years as well as we also have a keen interest in different types of games and that is the main reason we choose this dataset.

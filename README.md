The purpose of the dataset is to find out the popularity of different games across different platforms as well as to check when those games were released including a brief rating summary of those games. The dataset was provided by CC0 which was updated 8 months, which covered all the games that were released from 1995-2021. It also contained the average rating score as well as the different user reviews based on different platforms. Those data in the table were referenced from the metacritic website which is a website that gives both ranking and rating of games, movies, TV shows, and music. This dataset suits our interest because video games are getting popular with different age groups in the society and numerous games are released throughout the years as well as we also have a keen interest in different types of games and that is the main reason we choose this dataset.
